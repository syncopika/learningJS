#data structures using Javascript    

you can run these with node.js! after installing node, just open up the command-line, make sure you're in the directory with the right .js file (i.e. linkedlist.js), and then type in "node [filename].js" in the command-line (where [filename] is like linkedlist, or stack, etc).
    
additionally, I think these are mostly functional, but not completely bug-free currently. they should satisfy most general cases at least though I think.

##1. linked list
    a linked list has nodes and each node points to another one. 
    
    benefits: O(1) for inserting/deleting at head/tail pointers. no need to resize anything (i.e. with arrays).
    drawbacks: no random access/indexing, O(n) for inserting within the list. 
    
##2. stack
    follows a "first in, last out" approach. 
    
    benefits:
    drawbacks:

##3. queue
    follows a "first in, first out" approach.
    
    benefits: useful for breadth-first traversal in a tree. 
    drawbacks:

##4. heap
    a type of binary tree that can order elements by smallest or largest.
    
    benefits: useful for getting the smallest or largest element, can be used for sorting (HeapSort)
    drawbacks: 
    
##5. binary search tree (in progress)
